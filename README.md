## Creating a clean and responsive website for a professional portfolio.

-My motivation was to provide a clean, professional, and responsive portfolio website that follows accessibility standards.
-I built this project so that I would have an excellent framework to build a professional portfolio from.
-The problem that I solved is utilizing HTML and CSS to create an interactive yet astetically pleasing website.
-I learned that CSS is far more functional than I had realized. I also learned that there are an awfully large number of tools I can utilize to make something that looks simple but is in actuality quite complex.

# Installation

There are no steps required to install this project, simply launch the website in your preferred web browser.

# Usage

Launch the website and utilize the functions found therein.
